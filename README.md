# ETL with Python
Example notebooks to demonstrate ETL (Extraction, Transform and Load) process using Python

## ETL Using Pandas

* Source Data
We will use a salary data collected from a ready made garments factory

* Extraction
Data will be extraced from the raw excel format provided by the factory

* Transformation
Python's pandas library will be used to clean and harmonize the dataset

* Loading
Final dataset will be uploaded to a MySQL database

## ETL Using PETL

* Source Data
Bank of Canada's Exchange Rate and a local Expense file.

* Extraction
Bank of Canada's exchange rate will be extracked from their API using 'Requests' python module in JSON format and the local expense file which is in Excel format will be read into PETL table.

* Transformation
PETL will be used to merge and clean two datasets into the final one.

* Loading
Final dataset will be uploaded to a MySQL database.
